# WHACK notAFinancialAdvisor
 Codebase for the notAFinancialAdvisor project for Warwick HACK

## Inspiration
As a team of four computer science students, we're driven by the transformative potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency to reshape and decentralize the global economy. We see a future where decentralization not only empowers individuals but also redefines traditional finance, making it more accessible, transparent, and equitable for everyone.
Our goal is to develop a platform that offers comprehensive and user-friendly insights into the cryptocurrency market, tailored especially for newcomers and curious investors. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, we aim to demystify the complexities of the crypto world, enabling users to make informed decisions and engage with the blockchain ecosystem confidently. With our combined knowledge and enthusiasm, we're committed to building a tool that bridges the gap between innovation and accessibility in the crypto space.
## What it does
We have ideated and create a tool, powered by Fetch.ai, which helps people learn about crypto and make better informed decisions using a wide range of user generated content which is sorted and analysed to be more easily understood by the consumer.
## How we built it
-	Brainstormed and abstracted our problem into several self-contained modules to simplify the development  process.
-	Distributed the jobs between us based on our specialties and interests.
-	We followed an iterative development process to continually refine and test our programs at a steady pace.
-	Before starting development we read through the documentation and explored the available Fetch.ai examples on GitHub to familiarise ourselves with the codebase and packages.

## Challenges we ran into
-	Understanding and using the uagents functionalities in our program to facilitate the flow of data between the front end and back end.
-	Managing our time 
-	STAYING AWAKE!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-	We have ended this hackathon with a working product!
-	Developed a UI that is sleek, dynamic and user-friendly.
-	Leveraging Fetch.aiâ€™s innovative technology to promote the scalability of our program in the future.
-	Persevering, being resilient and pivoting on ideas when necessary.

## What we learned
-	How to use the Fetch.ai tech stack including uagents, agentverse and mailboxes in particular. 
-	How to work as a team effectively.
-	Our first full-stack development project in our first hackathon!

## What's next for notAFinancialAdvisor
-	Fully integrate crypto wallet compatibility with the website, personal portfolio.
-	Supporting more social media platforms on our widget window.
-	Developing our own agent network to build more interconnected platforms.
-	Integrate a chatbot which is well versed in financial literature to converse with the user and answer their enquiries.
